# Climate Risk Profiles

Climate risk profiles provide a concise, operational overview of the main climate hazards currently addressed in the Assessment Toolkit. Each profile follows the Toolkit risk logic (Hazard–Exposure–Vulnerability) and supports consistent comparison between a baseline (Business-as-Usual) and an adaptation (NbS/BGI) scenario.

For **general guidance** and interoperable workflows, see also : [<span class="underline">CLIMAAX CRA Handbook</span>](https://handbook.climaax.eu/intro.html) and [<span class="underline">CLIMAAX CRA Framework</span>](https://handbook.climaax.eu/CRA_steps/framework.html).

For **broader EU context** on climate impacts and risks, see [<span class="underline">EEA climate change impacts, risks and adaptation</span>](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/climate-change-impacts-risks-and-adaptation) (external overview).

  - *Note: this page focuses only on hazards currently covered by tutorials/materials. Other hazards (e.g., wildfires) may be addressed in future releases as the Toolkit expands*.

## Heavy rainfall

> ![](assets/ctb-climateriskprofiles_image1.png)Short-duration, high-intensity precipitation that can exceed infiltration and drainage capacity, generating rapid runoff and cascading impacts (e.g., pluvial flooding, erosion pulses). NbS/BGI effects are typically quantified by comparing baseline vs NbS runoff concentration and peak-response proxies.

## Flooding (fluvial, coastal)

> ![](assets/ctb-climateriskprofiles_image2.png)Fluvial flooding from river overflow driven by catchment runoff; coastal flooding ( see also sea level rise hazard) from storm surge and high water levels (influenced by sea-level conditions). Assessments typically map flood extent/depth (or hazard classes) and compare baseline vs NbS/BGI scenarios that increase retention/buffering or reduce exposure.

## Drought (water scarcity / agricultural drought)

> ![](assets/ctb-climateriskprofiles_image3.png)Sustained deficits in precipitation and/or soil moisture that reduce water availability for ecosystems, agriculture, and water supply systems, often intensified by higher evaporative demand. Outputs rely on deficit indices and impact proxies; NbS/BGI are evaluated through improved soil-moisture retention and reduced stress indicators vs baseline.

## Heat stress / heat waves

> ![](assets/ctb-climateriskprofiles_image4.png)Prolonged hot periods, frequently amplified in cities by urban morphology and land-surface properties (UHI). Profiles typically use screening layers or thermal-stress indicators to identify hotspots and quantify cooling/comfort gains under NbS/BGI vs baseline.

## Landslides (rainfall-induced)

> ![](assets/ctb-climateriskprofiles_image5.png)Slope instabilities triggered by intense/persistent rainfall that increases soil saturation and pore pressure. Outputs often include susceptibility/stability layers; NbS effects (e.g., land/vegetation management) are evaluated via scenario-External references: [<span class="underline">Climate-ADAPT – landslides</span>](https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/observatory/topics/health-impacts/landslides); [<span class="underline">EEA – extreme weather context</span>](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/extreme-weather-floods-droughts-and-heatwaves).

## Sea level rise (coastal flooding / storm surge)

> ![](assets/ctb-climateriskprofiles_image6.png)Long-term rise in mean sea level that shifts baseline coastal water levels and can amplify storm-surge impacts ( see also Flooding hazard). Assessments use water-level indicators and inundation-relevant proxies to compare baseline vs future and NbS/BGI buffering scenarios.

## Other perils (soil erosion and water quality)

> ![](assets/ctb-climateriskprofiles_image7.png)Additional dimensions relevant to the tutorials include water-driven soil erosion and water-quality impacts (nutrient/sediment transport), often linked to rainfall–runoff processes and land management. NbS/BGI benefits are captured via reductions in soil-loss proxies and improved nutrient/sediment indicators vs baseline.
