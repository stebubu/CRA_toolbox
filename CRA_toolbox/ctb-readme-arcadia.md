# ARCADIA

The ARCADIA Project is a pioneering initiative aimed at enhancing climate resilience in urban areas across Europe. By integrating advanced climate adaptation strategies, the project seeks to tackle urban challenges posed by climate change. ARCADIA focuses on developing innovative tools and methodologies to support city planners and policymakers in designing sustainable, climate-resilient urban environments. The project promotes interdisciplinary collaboration, bringing together experts from various fields to drive actionable solutions that enhance the adaptability of European cities against climate threats.

ARCADIA brings together 8 European regions and communities — 5 model regions (Italy, Croatia, Austria, Denmark, Sweden); 3 fellow regions (Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovenia) — to accelerate the adoption

### Context

The *EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change* seeks to help regions and communities across Europe become resilient to climate hazards. An important pillar of this mission is **CLIMAAX**, a Horizon‐Europe project coordinated by Deltares.

CLIMAAX is described as the flagship project of the EU mission that provides **financial, analytical and practical support** to regional authorities and communities in order to improve regional climate and emergency risk management plans[climaax.eu](https://www.climaax.eu). The project addresses the fact that reliable climate risk assessments require the combination of local information with pan‑European reference data and scenarios[cordis.europa.eu](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101093864). Many regions lack the capacity to integrate such data, so CLIMAAX will deliver a **standardised climate risk assessment (CRA) framework** and a toolbox of data, models and utilities, and will provide financial support and a help desk to at least 50 regions to carry out context‑specific assessments[cordis.europa.eu](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101093864).

Nature‑based solutions (NbS) and blue‑green infrastructure (BGI) play a central role in this context. The European Commission defines NbS as *“solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost‑effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience”*[climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu](https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/eu-adaptation-policy/key-eu-actions/NbS). Such interventions bring more diverse natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes and should benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of multiple ecosystem services[climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu](https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/eu-adaptation-policy/key-eu-actions/NbS). Because of their multi‑purpose character, NbS often deliver larger co‑benefits than conventional engineering measures[climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu](https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/eu-adaptation-policy/key-eu-actions/NbS). However, the literature notes that increased urban biodiversity and green spaces can also generate **ecosystem disservices**, such as higher risks of zoonotic diseases, intensified urban heat islands or human disconnection from nature[frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.791070/full). These disservices may be amplified by climate change and therefore need to be recognised and managed alongside the desired benefits[frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.791070/full).

### Purpose of the ARCADIA Assessment Toolkit

The **ARCADIA Assessment Toolkit** provides practical guidance to turn Nature-based Solutions (NbS) concepts into **executable Climate Risk Assessment (CRA) workflows**. Its purpose is to support a consistent and transparent assessment of climate risk and NbS/BGI performance through a clear chain from **data ingestion** to **indicators** and **baseline vs. NbS scenario comparison**, while keeping the workflow logic transferable across regions and tools.

The Toolkit is designed as a **living resource**. This GitBook is meant to remain accessible, searchable and updatable as Innovation Labs progress, new datasets become available and supporting data services mature, without changing the core CRA logic already documented in the workflows.

The Toolkit is **model-agnostic by design**. Tutorials may reference specific software stacks used in a region (including open-source, proprietary and locally adopted tools), **but the truly reusable element is the workflow structure**: required inputs, preprocessing steps, assumptions, data checks, indicator definitions and scenario-testing rules. This allows other regions to substitute equivalent tools while preserving comparability of results.

The primary beneficiaries are **regions and local authorities** using CRA outputs to support adaptation planning, prioritization and NbS/BGI investment decisions. Direct users are **technical practitioners** (agencies, consultancies, research partners and municipal technical units) with basic competences in GIS/data handling and the ability to run the relevant analysis chain. For practical details on prerequisites, typical user profiles and execution notes, refer to the “intended users / disclaimer” sections within each tutorial page.
