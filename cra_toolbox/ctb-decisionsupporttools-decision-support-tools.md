# Decision Support Tools

## Before you start / prerequisites

Before selecting or running any decision-support tool, practitioners should ensure the minimum prerequisites are in place. The CLIMAAX CRA Handbook provides a concise overview of how to start and what to prepare; see How to start (CLIMAAX).

Across the ARCADIA tutorials, recurring prerequisites include: (i) basic GIS and geodata handling skills; (ii) capacity to preprocess and quality-check inputs (projections, terrain, land cover/use, exposure proxies); (iii) basic understanding of modelling assumptions and limitations; (iv) correct interpretation of indicators and of the baseline vs NbS scenario logic used to quantify changes; and (v) adequate documentation to ensure reproducibility.

## Decision-support approaches and external resources

This section links to external tools, platforms, and methodologies that assist decision-making. Examples include early warning systems (real-time alerts and hazard mapping), scenario analysis tools (interactive modelling for climate impacts), and cost–benefit calculators to assess the viability of adaptation measures.

Selecting and prioritising adaptation measures—especially a broad set of Nature-based Solutions (NbS)—can be complex. This page introduces decision-support approaches that help officials and stakeholders make informed choices, with an emphasis on methods that better capture NbS-specific aspects (e.g., co-benefits and long-term ecosystem services) that traditional appraisal may undervalue.

Key tools and approaches include:

Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA). A structured method to compare options against multiple criteria (e.g., cost, risk-reduction effectiveness, co-benefits, feasibility, maintenance). The ICARUS project on road resilience recommends a four-step MCA to evaluate NbS options and link criteria to key performance indicators (KPIs): ICARUS Toolbox.

Cost–Benefit Analysis (CBA) with ecosystem valuation. Economic appraisal of NbS can be strengthened by explicitly valuing ecosystem services (e.g., flood storage by wetlands, health benefits from reduced heat). For an overview of NbS appraisal resources and planning considerations, see: Deltares – Nature-based solutions tools.

Scenario planning and climate-impact modelling can support decisions under deep uncertainty. Depending on local capacity, this may range from qualitative stress-testing (e.g., dry vs wet futures) to quantitative modelling. Where modelling is used, transparent assumptions and careful uncertainty communication are essential.

Geospatial tools and risk mapping are often central to decision-making. GIS-based workflows enable visualisation and spatial analyses (e.g., overlaying hazard, exposure and vulnerability proxies; identifying priority areas; communicating results through maps and dashboards).

Policy and planning integration tools. Checklists, alignment matrices and participatory methods help ensure selected measures fit within existing planning frameworks and governance processes. For examples of planning-oriented tools and stakeholder engagement approaches, see: UNU – Tools and methods for climate adaptation planning.

Overall, decision-support should remain inclusive and transparent. Structured stakeholder engagement can build legitimacy and improve implementation readiness, especially when NbS options deliver multiple co-benefits that matter to different groups.

## CLIMAAX CRA workflows and tools

ARCADIA is aligned with the broader European climate risk assessment (CRA) landscape. The CLIMAAX CRA Handbook provides interoperable workflows and notebooks that can complement ARCADIA methods where appropriate (e.g., for hazard screening, risk calculation, uncertainty handling). The hazard-level workflow pages below provide entry points and contain links to the specific tools/notebooks used for each hazard:
