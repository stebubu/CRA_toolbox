# Indicators and Data

Climate Risk Assessments (CRA) rely on a **transparent chain from datasets to indicators** and decision-relevant outputs. Within the ARCADIA Assessment Toolkit, indicators are used to operationalise the Hazard–Exposure–Vulnerability logic and to **compare a baseline (business-as-usual) scenario against an NbS/BGI scenario**. Tutorials provide the detailed, lab-specific data inputs and processing steps; the overview below focuses on indicator and data families that are replicable across regions, while keeping uncertainty and data limitations explicit.

## CLIMAAX CRA Handbook (interoperable reference)

For general guidance on dataset and indicators selection, workflow design and uncertainty handling, the CLIMAAX CRA Handbook provides a complementary, interoperable reference that aligns with WP8’s CRA framing:

• **[Datasets](https://handbook.climaax.eu/CRA_steps/analysis/datasets.html) :** Explore the requirements for combining hazard, exposure, and vulnerability data under current and future conditions.

• **[Hazard Data](https://handbook.climaax.eu/CRA_steps/analysis/hazard_data.html) :** Review technical specifications for understanding the intensity, frequency, and spatial distribution of climate risks.

• **[Exposure](https://handbook.climaax.eu/CRA_steps/analysis/exposure_data.html) and** **[Vulnerability](https://handbook.climaax.eu/CRA_steps/analysis/vulnerability_data.html) :** Access methodologies for characterizing assets, ecosystems, and populations prone to impact.

• **[Uncertainties](https://handbook.climaax.eu/CRA_steps/analysis/uncertainties.html) :** Learn how to address and communicate uncertainties inherent in exposure and vulnerability datasets.

## Indicators

Across the tutorials, indicators are grouped into (i) risk and vulnerability indicators, capturing the hazard signal and the spatial distribution of exposed and vulnerable receptors, and (ii) NbS/BGI performance indicators, capturing the change in risk drivers and impacts between baseline and NbS/BGI scenarios.

### Risk and vulnerability indicators

These indicators support screening, prioritisation and comparative assessment. Depending on the hazard, outputs may be expressed as maps (rasters/vectors), summary statistics over administrative or planning units, and scenario deltas.

### NbS/BGI performance indicators

Performance indicators describe the effect of measures along the risk chain (hazard attenuation, exposure reduction, vulnerability reduction), typically expressed as differences between baseline and NbS/BGI scenarios. Co-benefits relevant to the tutorials include soil conservation and water-quality regulation.

Table - European open-data sources referenced in the CRA tutorials (by data category).

The table above provides **a first, intentionally compact synthesis** of the European datasets referenced in the current tutorials. It is not meant to replace the tutorial-specific data documentation: as the Toolkit evolves, **a more structured repository and metadata scheme** (foreseen in follow-up activities) will enable more systematic referencing, traceability and reuse of datasets across regions.
