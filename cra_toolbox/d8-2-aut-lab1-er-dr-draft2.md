### Introduction and Objectives of the Climate Risk Assessment

#### Regional context.

#### [Lower Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Austria) is a predominantly rural, arable landscape where agriculture is the primary exposure unit for climate risk analysis. The regional CRA focuses on a**gricultural areas and evaluates risks at municipal and state scales.**

#### Innovation Lab 1 addresses water-related extremes—intense precipitation and drought—framed as **“too little and too much water.”** **NbS** such as [multifunctional hedgerows](https://resist-project.eu/story/nature-based-solutions-in-rural-areas-hedgerows-and-traditional-bocages/) are considered to reduce **water-induced soil erosion and drought impacts** in crop areas.

#### Under **future climate conditions**, both hazards are expected to intensify. The CRA therefore couples climate projections with exposure and vulnerability in farmland to quantify changing erosion and drought risks.

#### The assessment is co-developed with regional partners to support evidence-based adaptation, informing state-level strategy and coordination of local measures and land-use planning.

#### Scope of the tutorial.

This tutorial sets out a replicable Climate Risk Assessment for Lower Austria’s Innovation Lab 1, written to be followed by practitioners who need to reproduce the work in other regions. It explains how to **evaluate risk for two agricultural hazards—water-induced soil erosion and agricultural drought**—and how to test multifunctional hedgerows as an adaptation option under the overarching theme of “too little and too much water.”

The assessment targets **arable land and is designed to inform decisions at both state and municipal levels** by linking spatial risk with adaptation potential, so that stakeholders can prioritize where and how to implement measures. Co-development with regional partners ensures that the workflow supports real planning needs and coordination of local actions.

**Transferability is explicit:** users may replace European inputs with national or local datasets, adjust parameters, and adapt visualizations without altering the core logic of the workflow. The expected outcome is a **portable methodology** that connects risk assessment to targeted adaptation planning.

The tutorial also states the main boundaries of the approach. **Uncertainty in regional climate** projections and variability in **hedgerow performance** across soils, topographies, and practices limit precision; **prolonged drought followed by intense rainfall may exceed NbS capacity**, so results should feed an adaptive planning process.

* **Disclaimer**

> _This tutorial is intended as a general workflow example for Innovation Lab 1 and does not replace software-specific documentation (e.g., GIS, hydrological or crop/soil erosion modelling tools user/technical manuals). Users should already be familiar with the relevant geospatial data formats, data pre-processing techniques, and modelling concepts applicable to extreme precipitation, soil erosion, and agricultural drought, as well as with the specific input/output requirements and run functionalities of the modelling software before attempting to replicate this workflow._

#### CRA objectives.

The Lower Austria CRA aims to:

* Characterize **current and future** hazard conditions for **water-induced soil erosion and agricultural drought** in arable land using EURO-CORDEX and ÖKS15 projections together with national topographic and exposure datasets.
* Quantify **spatial risk and identify hotspots at municipal and state levels** to support evidence-based adaptation and coordination of local measures.
* Evaluate the effectiveness of **multifunctional hedgerows** as a Nature-based Solution to reduce erosion and drought impacts (and wind erosion where relevant) and indicate where they deliver the highest benefits.
* Provide a **transferable methodology** that links risk assessment with targeted adaptation planning and can be replicated by substituting datasets and adjusting parameters.
* **Inform adaptive planning under uncertainty** through a co-developed process that combines spatial risk with adaptation potential.

#### Intended users.

The Climate Risk Assessment developed in Innovation Lab 1 is designed to support both **broad-scale strategic planning at the state level** and the **coordination of local adaptation measures** in rural, arable regions of Lower Austria. It addresses stakeholders from **science and administration** who are directly involved in **land-use planning and climate adaptation**, and it is co-developed together with partners from the pilot region.

By combining spatial risk assessment with adaptation potential, the CRA is intended to inform **decision-making processes and help authorities and practitioners** prioritize actions and align them with long-term climate resilience goals.

### Hazard – Soil erosion.

#### Description and context

The assessment of soil erosion in Innovation Lab 1 focuses on **water-induced processes affecting arable land** in Lower Austria. The CRA applies the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to estimate average annual soil loss and to evaluate how erosion risks may evolve under changing climate conditions. The approach builds on an Austria-wide erosion risk study ([Schmaltz et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880923002499)) and refines it for the regional scale by incorporating **updated climate projections and local exposure patterns**.

Future scenarios are produced by coupling the RUSLE framework with EURO-CORDEX precipitation and temperature projections under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The resulting analysis provides a **spatially explicit view of soil erosion risks**, serving as a basis for testing adaptation measures such as multifunctional hedgerows and for informing land-use planning in agricultural landscapes.

#### Data sources and tools

The soil erosion workflow in Innovation Lab 1 builds on the Austrian national erosion **risk assessment described by** [**Schmaltz et al. (2023)**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880923002499), adapting it to the regional scale of Lower Austria.

The approach combines **high-resolution national datasets with climate projections** to parameterize the RUSLE model. Hazard drivers such as rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, topography, and land management are derived from Austrian sources including **ÖKS15 climate scenarios, the 10 m DEM, INVEKOS crop parcel data, and national soil maps**. These are complemented by socio-economic data (Farm Structure Survey) to integrate exposure and vulnerability.

To ensure that the workflow can be replicated in other regions, European open datasets provide equivalent substitutes: Copernicus DEM for topography, the Copernicus Climate Data Store for climate projections and impact indicators, and ESDAC for soil parameters. This dual setup—national where available, European where needed—guarantees both local accuracy and transferability.

In addition to the baseline, ESDAC also provides future projections of R under climate change, calculated from bias-corrected regional climate model outputs (EURO-CORDEX). These projections indicate a general increase in rainfall erosivity towards 2050, especially in central and northern Europe, reflecting the expected intensification of extreme precipitation. Users can therefore choose between present-day R for baseline assessments and climate-adjusted R layers for scenario analyses in RUSLE applications._

Figure 5 - large-scale assessments, vulnerability proxies are available from Eurostat’s experimental geospatial agricultural census datasets (multi-resolution grids, 1–80 km), providing spatially harmonised indicators on farm number, cultivated areas, farmer demographics (age, gender), livestock, labour, and production methods. While coarser in scale, these can serve as vulnerability layers when regional data are unavailable.

The soil erosion workflow is implemented using a **RUSLE-based modelling approach**, adapted to the regional scale of Lower Austria. The model itself is not a standalone application but is coded and executed within a spatial analysis environment. **RUSLE is essentially a multiplicative model: once all factor layers (R, K, LS, C, P) are prepared,** the application reduces to a raster-based calculation in GIS, as will be detailed later in the methodological section.

To handle geospatial data, preprocess inputs, and visualize outputs, a **GIS platform such as QGIS** is used. This provides the necessary functionality to manage raster and vector datasets, derive topographic parameters from the DEM, and integrate climate and land-use data.

The combination of RUSLE calculations with GIS processing ensures that erosion risk can be **mapped consistently** across agricultural areas and aggregated at municipal and state levels for decision support.

#### Methodology

**Step 1 - Data acquisition and preparation**

The first step of the workflow is the collection and preprocessing of all input datasets required to parameterize the RUSLE model. **When local and national datasets are available, each factor must be recalculated specifically for the study area.**

* Topography (LS-factor): **directly derived from the DEM** using the LS-factor function of SAGA GIS within QGIS. This ensures a spatially explicit representation of slope length and steepness adapted to local terrain conditions.
* Rainfall erosivity (R-factor), soil erodibility (K-factor), cover-management (C-factor), and support practice (P-factor): require **reclassification of local data sources.** Values are assigned using lookup tables based on soil maps, parcel and crop information, and national climate data, as described in the previous section.

Preprocessing: includes harmonizing coordinate systems, resampling datasets to a common resolution, and rasterizing vector inputs such as field parcels or management practices.

As an alternative, where local data are not available, users may rely on the precomputed ESDAC products (R at 500 m, K/C/P at 100 m). These datasets are coarser in resolution but provide a consistent and harmonised European baseline for exploratory assessments and large-scale applications, as illustrated in the example maps provided below.

**Step 2 - Model setup and run.**

The modelling step corresponds to the direct application of the RUSLE formula, i.e. the **multiplication of all prepared factor layers** via basic _raster calculator_ (_map algebra_) in GIS:

E=R×K×LS×C×P

where E is the estimated average annual soil loss (“Erosion”) in **t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹**, see also (\[1])

Each factor layer (R, K, LS, C, P) had been previously (Step 2) derived or reclassified from local datasets, harmonised to the same projection and resolution.

The resulting erosion map provides the **annual mean soil loss rate**, which represents the standard output unit for RUSLE applications.

The erosion hazard map derived from the RUSLE model provides the core spatial output, but its value lies in how the results are analysed and interpreted. In Innovation Lab 1, this step focuses on transforming raw model outputs into information that can support planning and decision-making.

First, the raster of mean annual soil loss (_t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹_) can be **aggregated from small to larger territorial unit ( e.g. municipal and state boundaries** (as in the example of Figure 8), allowing direct comparison across relevant administrative units and integration into existing planning frameworks. This allows local authorities to identify where erosion risk is systematically higher within their jurisdiction.

Second, the analysis highlights **erosion hotspots** by applying thresholds to the raster map and overlaying them with cropland exposure. These hotspots indicate priority areas for targeted interventions, including the implementation of multifunctional hedgerows and other Nature-based Solutions.

Third, **scenario comparisons** are undertaken. Results can be analysed **under different climate projections** (EURO-CORDEX, ÖKS15) to quantify the expected increase in hazard due to climate change.

Finally, the interpretation integrates **socio-economic vulnerability indicators** **at municipal level**, such as farm structure and dependence on agricultural income. This combination of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability highlights areas where physical risk coincides with lower adaptive capacity, providing a risk-oriented basis for prioritisation.

Right: overlay of the same erosion map with INVEKOS reference parcels (Agrarmarkt Austria, 2025-1, Table 2), which represent agricultural blocks and digitised landscape elements under the EU CAP regulation. This integration allows soil erosion estimates to be directly linked to field-scale agricultural units. Aggregation example over larger territorial unit is provided in the lower figure.

**Step 4 - NbS testing.**

The testing of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) focuses on the introduction of **multifunctional hedgerows** in arable land as a measure to mitigate soil erosion. Within the RUSLE framework, the presence of hedgerows does not require changes to the hazard drivers (R, K) but can be represented through adjustments of the **LS- and C-factors**.

* **C-factor (cover and management):** hedgerows increase permanent vegetative cover, reduce raindrop impact and promote soil stability (\[2],\[3]). This effect is simulated by assigning lower C values to cropland areas adjacent to or intersected by hedgerows.
* **LS-factor (slope length and steepness):** the establishment of hedgerows effectively interrupts slope length and alters runoff pathways, reducing the effective contributing area upslope of a pixel. In GIS terms this can be simulated by shortening slope lengths or by recalculating LS with breaks introduced along hedgerow alignments **modifying DTM to count for new morphology induced by NBS before reprocessing.**

The workflow in steps 2 and 3 shall then be repeated with adjusted LS and C values representing hedgerow implementation. The comparison of “with” and “without NbS” maps quantify the potential reduction of annual soil loss, highlighting those hotspots where hedgerows deliver the highest benefit.

**Integration of hedges as a nature-based solution for erosion mitigation in the RUSLE model (L-factor)**

The objective of this workflow was to represent hedgerows as a nature-based solution within the RUSLE framework by explicitly modifying the slope length (L) factor through terrain- and flow-based analysis. The approach combines terrain analysis, rule-based hedge placement, and hydrological enforcement to quantify how hedges disrupt downslope runoff connectivity.

First, a 10 m resolution digital elevation model (DEM) was hydrologically conditioned by filling depressions to ensure continuous flow paths. Specific contributing area (SCA) was used as a proxy for the RUSLE L-factor, which was used to prioritise placement of hedges based on the upslope contributing area (L-factor), thus ensuring that hedges are preferentially placed where erosion risk is highest.

Potential hedge locations were generated from contour lines extracted from the DEM, constrained to agriculturally relevant areas (intersecting with arable paddocks), elevation limits (<600 m), and slopes exceeding a defined threshold (>4°). Contour segments were split into individual line features. Additional filtering enforced minimum hedge length (500 m) and spatial thinning rules to avoid unrealistically dense hedge networks. Two scenarios were produced by varying slope (4°, 5°), L-factor (>40, >100), and spacing thresholds (100 m, 150 m).

To account for the hydrological effect of hedges, selected hedge lines were rasterised and “burned” into the DEM as elevated linear barriers. This modified DEM was subsequently filled again to remove artefacts and used to recompute flow accumulation and SCA. The resulting hedge-adjusted SCA raster represents a reduced effective slope length downslope of hedges and was directly integrated as an adapted L-factor in RUSLE for the two hedge scenarios.

Overall, the method provides a spatially explicit and process-based representation of hedges as runoff-interrupting features, allowing erosion mitigation effects of hedge scenarios to be quantified consistently within the RUSLE modelling framework.

### Hazard – Agricultural drought.

#### Description and context

The second hazard assessed in Innovation Lab 1 is **agricultural drought**, understood here as the insufficient availability of soil water to sustain crop growth during the vegetation period. In the context of Lower Austria, drought has become an increasingly relevant climate risk alongside water-induced soil erosion. While the region is traditionally well supplied with rainfall, recent summers have shown more frequent dry spells and heat periods, affecting yields and farm income.

Within the CRA, drought is approached through an **indicator-based method** that combines climate variables (precipitation and temperature) with soil and land use characteristics to estimate water deficit conditions in cropland. Climate change scenarios (EURO-CORDEX, ÖKS15) are used to explore how frequency and severity of droughts may evolve under future conditions.

The objective is to provide **spatially explicit drought hazard maps**, comparable with the erosion analysis, and to identify where agricultural areas are most exposed to prolonged soil moisture deficits. These results allow stakeholders to evaluate the relative importance of “too little water” in comparison to “too much water” and to consider adaptation options at both municipal and regional planning levels.

#### Data sources

The assessment of agricultural drought in Innovation Lab 1 is explicitly based on the [**CLIMAAX Risk Workflow for agricultural systems**](https://handbook.climaax.eu/notebooks/workflows/DROUGHTS/02_agriculture_drought/AGRICULTURE_Risk_workflow_description.html). By design this CRA methodology follows an **indicator-based approach** that combines climate drivers, soil water holding capacity, crop exposure, and vulnerability information to derive **potential yield losses under rainfed conditions**.

In this section we therefore focus only on the **datasets required to apply the workflow**, both at Austrian and European scale. The full methodological description is not repeated here but is entirely referred to the official [**CLIMAAX Risk Workflow for agricultural systems**](https://handbook.climaax.eu/notebooks/workflows/DROUGHTS/02_agriculture_drought/AGRICULTURE_Risk_workflow_description.html).

For the regional application in Lower Austria, the CRA uses **ÖKS15 climate scenarios** (1 km), **EURO-CORDEX simulations** (12.5 km), and national meteorological observations as the basis for calculating reference evapotranspiration (ET₀) and effective evapotranspiration (ETₐ).

Soil water holding capacity is derived from **national soil maps**, while exposure is defined through the **INVEKOS parcel dataset** with crop-specific attributes.

**National agricultural statistics** provide information on crop production and economic value, while irrigation distribution and socio-economic data from the **Farm Structure Survey** represent the main vulnerability layers.

Elevation and climate zoning are also included to reflect topographic and thermal conditions influencing crop growth.

To ensure replicability outside Austria, equivalent **European open datasets** can be used, such as **Copernicus CDS** (precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration indices), **ESDAC** (soil hydraulic properties), **MapSPAM/FAO-IIASA GAEZ** (crop maps, yields, irrigation, climate zones), the **Copernicus DEM**, and **Eurostat agricultural census data**. This dual setup allows both accurate local analysis and transferability to other regions.

#### Methodology (addition)

As mentioned above the CLIMAAX agricultural drought workflow served as a basis for this modelling. For the general methodology refer to the CLIMAAX handbook. The workflow was modified so that instead of a periodic daily average of the climatic parameters, daily resolved parameters were used to calculate ET<sub>0</sub>. This should ensure that particularly dry years are not averaged out too much. This results in annual average yield loss values ​​for the studied periods and scenarios (Historical 1971-2000; RCP8.5 2041-2070; RCP4.5 2071-2100; RCP8.5 2071-2100). The yield loss calculation was carried out for eight different crops, which are of great importance in agricultural production in Lower Austria. In total, an ensemble of six EURO-CORDEX models was used for each scenario and period described.

**Hedge scenarios for wind-effect modelling for agricultural drought.**

_Identifying the prevailing wind direction for optimal hedge placement_

The first step involves determining the prevailing wind direction to place hedges at right angles to this direction. For the case of the Wagram Lab, long-term [annual wind data](https://doi.org/10.60669/6yna-mw14) (1991–2024) from two meteorological stations (Langenlebarn and Stockerau) were analysed. Daily occurrences of wind direction were aggregated by cardinal and intercardinal directions (e.g., N, NE, E) and used to identify the dominant wind direction relevant for hedge effects in the context of agricultural drought. Based on the prevailing wind direction across the two stations (Langenlebarn: southwest, Stockerau: west), the dominant wind direction of 247.5° (WSW) was selected as most relevant for the study area (Figure 10). Hedges with an orientation of SSE-NNW were therefore considered as most optimal to reduce the effect of wind on evapotranspiration in the context of agricultural drought.

![](../.gitbook/assets/d8-2-aut-lab1-er-dr-draft2_image12.png)

Figure 10 - Occurrences of wind direction (%) based on weather station measurements at Langenlebarn and Stockerau (1991-2024).

_Extraction of wind-perpendicular hedge lines from paddock boundaries_

The second step involves generating hedge geometries directly from agricultural paddock boundaries to represent plausible hedge line scenarios. In this example, the land parcels from the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS or InVeKoS) are used. Parcels classified as arable land were first converted into boundary line segments. These boundaries were split and merged based on changes in segment orientation (tolerance = 45°) to obtain continuous line segments with generally consistent azimuths. Segment azimuths were then compared against directions perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction (±90°), allowing for a specified angular tolerance (30° or 45° for different scenarios).

From these candidate segments, only those located on the western side of paddocks (i.e. facing the prevailing wind) were retained. Additional filtering was applied to ensure that, for narrow paddocks, only the most representative boundary segment, i.e. the longest, was kept. Finally, hedge candidates were filtered by minimum length (40 m) and spatially thinned using a band-based approach to enforce a minimum spacing between hedges (150 m or 300 m for different scenarios). Within each north–south band, overlapping or closely spaced candidates were resolved by retaining the longer segment. The resulting hedge lines form the spatial input for the four hedge scenarios used in subsequent analyses. The four hedge scenarios are given by defining two angular tolerances for hedge orientation relative to wind direction (±30° and ±45°) with two minimum spacing constraints between hedges (150 m and 300 m).

_Spatial modelling of wind shelter effects of hedges_

The third and final step involves the approximation of hedge effects on evapotranspiration. Change factors for potential evapotranspiration (ET<sub>0</sub>) were derived to represent the sheltering effect of hedgerows on near-surface microclimatic conditions in the lee of the hedge. Following the empirical findings of Orfánus and Eitzinger (2010) – a study also undertaken in Lower Austria, ET<sub>0</sub> was assumed to increase with distance from the hedge, reflecting a gradual reduction in wind protection and shading effects. Observed ET<sub>0</sub> values at different distances (8 m, 20 m, and 80 m) under both low- and high-demand atmospheric conditions were normalised relative to ET<sub>0</sub> at 80 m, which was defined as the reference condition (change factor = 1.0). Across demand regimes (low vs. high), this resulted in relative change factors of approximately 0.4–0.5 close to the hedge and values approaching unity at 80 m distance.

Based for each hedge scenario, as well as the actual hedges planted by the Agrarbezirksbehörde (ABB), a raster-based change factor was calculated to represent wind shelter effects on evapotranspiration in the lee of hedges. For each raster cell (10 m), the shortest distance to the nearest hedge was computed, and cells located downwind of hedges were identified using angular relationships between wind direction and hedge orientation. A linear distance-decay function was applied to a factor of change, with maximum shelter at the hedge (0.5) and a gradual reduction to no effect beyond a defined distance of 80 m. The result is a spatially explicit change-factor raster that can be used to modify evapotranspiration in subsequent modelling steps (Figure 11).

![](../.gitbook/assets/d8-2-aut-lab1-er-dr-draft2_image13.png)

Figure 11 - Example of a hedge scenario with change factors for evapotranspiration in the Wagram Lab.

Given the site specifics of the field measurements undertaken by Orfánus and Eitzinger (2010), this approach assumes an average hedgerow height of 8 m, consistent shelter effects across soil types, a uniform prevailing wind direction, and a maximum effective shelter distance of 80 m despite potential site-specific variability. A key limitation is the implicit assumption that yield responses are primarily driven by soil moisture availability during dry summer conditions. While this assumption is appropriate for drought years, it likely overestimates the positive effects of reduced ET<sub>0</sub> under average climatic conditions, as it does not explicitly account for potential negative effects related to reduced photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) or below-ground competition. Tree and hedge effects are expected to be beneficial under very dry conditions but neutral or negative under normal conditions (Koch et al., 2024; Majaura et al., 2025; Reuse & Langhof, 2025). This limitation is partly mitigated within the CLIMAAX framework, as the relative importance of ET increases under dry conditions, thereby reducing the influence of shelter effects in wetter or average years.
