# Implementation Guidelines

Planning does not stop at selecting solutions: effective climate adaptation requires robust implementation, long-term management, and institutional embedding of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) and Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI). This page summarises practical considerations for moving from assessment results to implementation, with emphasis on co-creation, policy integration, financing, maintenance, and monitoring.

For established practice-oriented guidance on participation and co-design, see [IB-Green resources](https://ib-green.nweurope.eu). For framing multi-benefit adaptation and implementation pathways, see [UNU guidance and resources](https://unu.edu).

Across ARCADIA, the CRA tutorials support decision-making by comparing a baseline (business-as-usual) configuration against an NbS/BGI scenario. This makes the expected risk-reduction performance and co-benefits explicit and helps translate technical evidence into prioritisation, design choices, and investment justification.

Key implementation considerations include:

* Stakeholder co-creation and buy-in (inclusive processes, clear roles, and risk ownership).
* Policy and planning integration (mainstreaming measures into statutory plans, sectoral strategies, and permitting workflows).
* Financing and resourcing (blending funding streams and making co-benefits visible for wider eligibility).
* Phased implementation and pilots (start small, learn, and scale through adaptive management).
* Maintenance and governance (define responsibilities, budgets, and skills for long-term operation).
* Monitoring and evaluation (select indicators early, track performance, and update the assessment over time).

For examples on integrating NbS into transport and infrastructure planning, see [ICARUS](https://icarus.project.cedr.eu). For broader scientific background on hybrid strategies and the role of NbS in diversified adaptation portfolios, see [peer-reviewed syntheses](https://www.sciencedirect.com).

## CLIMAAX CRA Handbook (interoperable reference)

> ![](../.gitbook/assets/ctb-implementationguidelines_image1.png)ARCADIA operational workflows align with broader European CRA practice. The **CLIMAAX CRA Handbook** can be used as an interoperable methodological reference, from scoping and workflow selection to risk analysis, uncertainty awareness, and monitoring.

## From assessment to decision-making

> Beyond the pilot contexts, tutorial outputs can be re-used as transferable decision-support components in areas with comparable hazard drivers, land use patterns, and data availability. The following examples illustrate how baseline vs NbS/BGI comparisons translate into planning and implementation questions.
>
> ![](../.gitbook/assets/ctb-implementationguidelines_image2.png)**Emilia-Romagna (Lab 3 — drought / water regulation):** Use the baseline vs NbS scenario comparison to quantify changes in water balance components and irrigation-relevant performance metrics. This supports prioritising interventions in sub-areas where retention and infiltration gains are highest and helps justify integration into water management and rural development programmes.
>
> **Lower Austria (Lab 3 — urban heat stress):** Translate heat-stress indicators into spatial prioritisation for depaving, shading, and greening measures. Outputs can inform zoning of intervention areas and support selection of design options aligned with local constraints and co-benefits.
>
> **Skåne, Helsingborg (Lab 2 — flooding and BGI planning):** Combine flood-related outputs with BGI planning layers to identify priority corridors and multifunctional locations for retention and conveyance. This supports spatial planning, permitting discussions, and staged implementation plans.

## Operational Guidance: ARCADIA interactive PDF (iPDF)

> To complement the tutorials, the project developed **an interactive PDF (iPDF)** designed as a practical “**guide to the guidelines**” for NbS and BGI. The iPDF curates implementation-oriented resources and allows navigation by project needs and by climate hazard, supporting practitioners in finding relevant guidance without aiming to be exhaustive.
